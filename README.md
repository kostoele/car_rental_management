# Car Rental Management Software for "Rent a Car"(management.rent-a-car.de)

# Description
Our company rents particularly high-quality cars for a special target group to customers. A client can choose between three cars and rent a car for at least one hour. For this purpose, the customer can make a request through different channels (email, website, WhatsApp...). Shuttle services such as airport <-> hotel are also offered. Our customers can be both private individuals and companies.

# Purpose of the app

The application should enable us to organize our customers, cars, invoices and rental contracts. By organize we mean create, edit, view and delete.
A customer has the usual master data like name, surname, date of birth, address. A car has a manufacturer, a model, license plate and possible damages. A rental agreement has the following information: The customer with whom the rental agreement is concluded, a start and end date, a price, and which car is rented. An invoice is issued after a service has been rendered. After a rental agreement has been created, an invoice should also be created.
